As the name suggests in this assignment you will learn how to fine-tune a pretrained model like BERT on a downstream task to improve much more superior performance compared to the methods discussed so far. Like previous assignments we will continue to work on the SST-2 sentiment dataset as well ask introduce a new task to work on i.e. [Microsfot Research Paraphrase Corpus](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52398). This assignment will also make heavy use of the [Hugging Face's Transformers Library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index). Don't worry if you are not familiar with the library, we will discuss its usage in detail.\n","\n","Note: Access to a GPU will be crucial for working on this assignment. So do select a GPU runtime in Colab before you start working.\n","\n","Suggested Reading: [Jacob Devlin, Ming-Wei Chang, Kenton Lee, Kristina Toutanova *BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional
